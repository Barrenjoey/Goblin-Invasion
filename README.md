# Goblin-Invasion
This is the first project i created using the Python programming language. The main Python package used here is the Pygame module.
I think that Pygame is a great module to learn Python with as it quite easy to implement things, and you can see the results
of that implementation almost immediately.
The game is quite simple, however it offers quite a bit of functionality. For example, there are various graphical components, a combat
system, leveling system, skill points, health bars, pick-up and collidable objetcs. My intention was to try and accomplish the
functionality of each task i set out to do, rather than creating a fun and challenging game.
